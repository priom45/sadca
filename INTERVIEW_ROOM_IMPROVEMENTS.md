## Database Changes

### New Table: `interview_session_backups`
Stores interview session state for recovery purposes.

**Columns:**
- `session_id` - Unique identifier for the session
- `user_id` - Reference to the user
- `current_question_index` - Current progress
- `time_remaining` - Remaining interview time
- `current_transcript` - Live speech transcript
- `text_answer` - Text-based answer
- `code_answer` - Code solution
- `selected_language` - Programming language choice
- `interview_type` - Type of interview (realistic/smart/adaptive)
- `last_saved` - Timestamp of last save

**Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Users can only access their own session backups
- Policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

## Integration with Existing Components

All new components are seamlessly integrated into the `RealisticInterviewRoom` component:

1. **EnhancedCodeEditor** replaces the basic textarea for code input
2. **TestCaseAccordion** replaces the flat test results display
3. **VoiceActivityIndicator** adds visual feedback for speech recognition
4. **TranscriptDisplay** replaces the simple transcript text box
5. **QuestionCard** replaces the basic question display
6. **SessionRecoveryModal** appears on load if a recoverable session exists

## User Experience Flow

### Starting an Interview
1. System checks for recoverable sessions
2. If found, shows recovery modal with session details
3. User can choose to resume or start fresh
4. Interview initializes with proper state

### During the Interview
1. Session auto-saves every 30 seconds
2. Visual indicators show speech detection status
3. Clean test case display with expandable details
4. Professional code editor for writing solutions
5. Clear countdown warnings before auto-submit

### Handling Interruptions
1. If browser closes, session is saved
2. On return, user sees recovery modal
3. All progress (questions, answers, code) is restored
4. Time remaining is preserved
5. User continues from exact point of interruption

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations
- Auto-save throttled to 30-second intervals
- Local storage used as primary cache with Supabase as backup
- Efficient state management prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading of test cases only when needed

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if session recovery fails
- Clear error messages for users
- Automatic cleanup of corrupted or stale sessions
- Retry logic for database operations

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast colors for readability
- Clear visual indicators for all states

## Benefits Summary

## Testing Recommendations

To verify all improvements are working correctly:

1. Start an interview and close browser mid-session
2. Reopen and verify recovery modal appears
3. Test code editor features (copy, fullscreen, tab indent)
4. Run code and verify test case accordion displays correctly
5. Test voice recognition with silence countdown
6. Verify auto-save is working (check browser console and database)
7. Test on mobile devices for responsiveness
8. Verify accessibility with screen reader

## Conclusion

These comprehensive improvements transform the interview room from a basic interface into a professional, industry-standard platform. Users now have a reliable, feature-rich environment that matches or exceeds the quality of leading technical interview platforms. The combination of better UI design, robust session management, and clear visual feedback creates a stress-free experience that allows candidates to focus on demonstrating their skills rather than fighting with the interface.
