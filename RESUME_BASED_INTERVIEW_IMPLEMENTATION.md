## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow:
1. **Resume Upload** → Parse → Store → Analyze (background)
2. **Interview Config** → Resume selection → Question generation mode
3. **Session Start** → Hybrid question selection (60% DB + 40% AI)
4. **Question Display** → User answers → Record response
5. **Answer Analysis** → Base feedback + Resume validation → Store with validation data
6. **Interview Complete** → Generate alignment report → Display comprehensive results

### Question Generation Strategy:
- **Database Questions**: Selected based on relevance score calculated from:
  - Skill matching (resume skills vs question content)
  - Experience level appropriateness
  - Difficulty alignment with experience
  - Company/role specific filtering

- **AI-Generated Questions**: Created using:
  - Resume skills and projects context
  - Experience level and years
  - Previous answer history
  - Specific technologies and domains
  - Company and role requirements

### Resume Analysis Pipeline:
1. File upload to Supabase Storage
2. Parse resume content (text extraction)
3. Initial skill detection (keyword matching)
4. Background AI analysis trigger
5. Deep analysis: structure extraction, skill verification, experience calculation
6. Store analysis results with metadata
7. Mark analysis as complete

### Security & Privacy:
- Row Level Security on all tables
- Users can only access their own resumes
- Private storage bucket with user-specific folders
- Secure file upload with size limits
- Resume deletion cascades properly
